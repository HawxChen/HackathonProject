# [Robot] Dalle
*  We can control Dalle through voice commands and then Dalle will follow our orders to speedup, slow down, stop, rotate and turn back.
*  Dalle is equipped with Camera for recording and gesture control.
*  We also implemented Plan B, Emergency Control, to stop Dalle if Dalle runs too far.
*  Dalle was implemented in 24 hours, I spent only one Hour for sleeping.
